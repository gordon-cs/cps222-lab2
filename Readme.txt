Google Test setup:
* In a parent directory (outside this repo):
    git clone https://github.com/google/googletest
    cd googletest/googletest/make
    make
    ./sample1_unittest
  (This works, but then when I try my own tests, they get tons of link
  errors.)

* This works on Ubuntu, but only for its example (not my code)
